## Problem Description
The task for this project is to model and build a relational database as a multi-sector medical facility. Currently, the facility is running into record organization issues that ultimately result in billing delays, overlapping patient visits, and a lack of storage capacity. From this relational database, the facility hopes to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and provide accurate data tracking. This system should include the management of patients, medical staff members, appointments and schedules, billing requests, insurance claims, prescriptions and medications, and storage capacity. This database will, in turn, optimize the organization’s daily operations, improve patient care, and increase workflow efficiency.

## Data Model
### Explaination of data model:
This data model represents a hospital management system, detailing the relationships between patients, staff, medical records, billing, insurance, prescriptions, and storage. Patients visit the hospital, where they are attended to by staff members such as doctors and nurses. Their medical history, prescriptions, and visits are recorded in the system. Billing and insurance claims are tracked, ensuring proper financial management. The hospital also maintains an inventory of medicines and storage facilities, with a system in place for tracking the receipt and distribution of medical supplies. This model helps streamline hospital operations by organizing patient care, financial transactions, and resource management efficiently.
