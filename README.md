## Problem Description
The task for this project is to model and build a relational database as a multi-sector medical facility. Currently, the facility is running into record organization issues that ultimately result in billing delays, overlapping patient visits, and a lack of storage capacity. From this relational database, the facility hopes to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and provide accurate data tracking. This system should include the management of patients, medical staff members, appointments and schedules, billing requests, insurance claims, prescriptions and medications, and storage capacity. This database will, in turn, optimize the organizationâ€™s daily operations, improve patient care, and increase workflow efficiency.
